            As a side note, I've spent my summer giving my final project,
            'MReversi' for Spring se450, a gui, unlimited undo/redo and
            tcp connectivity so players can play across a network.  I've
            also ported a version to my Java capable phone with j2me.  My
            next step is to give the phone version tcp capability so phone
            players can play computer players or whatever.

           Overall, I enjoyed and learned a lot in SE450. To date, it
           has been the most time consuming class I've taken possibly
           ever so you were quite accurate in your warnings early on
           that we students need to seriously make time.
         </p>
         <p>
           After many years of project work and software
           implementations at my day job, there was one thing in
           particular about the final project that, whether
           intentional or not, very accurately represented "real
           world" work. That is, the ambiguity of the assignment. No
           software project I've been involved in has ever been in
           neat, clearly defined, package as many of the projects and
           assignments I've worked on at DePaul. Due to the complexity
           of what you were asking and a certain amount of
           open-endedness, it would have been less stressful to not
           have any other assignments during development of the final
           project, but again, real life doesn't always allow us the
           privilege of working on only one thing at a time.
         </p>
