Is there anyone using Eclipe?
At this point I'm using it to edit stand alone files... I did not have
a chance to see how to set it up to open all these files in a single
solution, for editing, build, testing (even  debugging).
If someone is already using Eclipse in "full mode" and could share
with the steps to get there, I would really appreciate it.

------------------------------------------------------------------

I am using it.  I believe if you download at least 3.x you will have
JUnit and Ant plugins standard.  Ant should be set up "out of the box"
and the only thing you'd need for JUnit is to edit the build path and
make sure the JUnit jar is there (it isn't by default; click "external
jars" and navigate to
"C:\eclipse\plugins\org.junit_3.8.2.v200706111738" or similar to see
and select "junit.jar").

What I've been doing is creating a new java project -&gt; "Java Project
from Existing Ant Buildfile", "browse" to the build.xml for the given
homework and select it (hence I've got a unique project for each
homework).  this sets things up nicely.

You should be able to right-click on any TEST file and "Run as" will
give you "Junit test" as an option - just select that to run your
tests in an appropriate way.  You should have something similar with
ant: right click on the build.xml and choose from "Run as" "Ant build
file..." (make sure it's the one with the ellipsis).  The "run dialog"
will appear and you can then add the junit jar to the classpath tab
therein.

Sorry this is not the best, most linear instructions - don't have time
right now to do better.  Feel free to post followup questions - I will
do my best to clarify as needed.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Back up your files somewhere.

Open Eclipse.

Go to Window-&gt;Open Perspective-&gt;Java

Go to File-&gt;New-&gt;Project. Dialog appears. Choose from the tree:
Java/Java Project. New Dialog appears.

Fill in "Project Name". It has to be the same as the folder where you
have your homework files (i.e. hw1 or hw2). Choose "Create project
from existing source" option. Browse button becomes enabled. Navigate
to the folder where you have your homework files and choose it. Now
the "Finish" button at the bottom of the dialog becomes enabled. Click
it. Now the project is created, packages are parsed and you can see
proper Java hierarchy. Java files are compiled every time you save
them.

I run ant from command line to build and run tests.

------------------------------------------------------------------

I wanted to share some of the tips and tricks I picked up over the 5
years I've been using eclipse both when I was at UT Austin just before
finishing and on the job.

I do prefer the wizards, Ruby support, and visual tools in Netbeans.
I would use Netbeans for everything, but most java shops I've been at
are eclipse/rational/websphere whatever users.  So I just roll with
whatever enables me to eat.

For the netbeans users: some of these tips will apply to your IDE as
well.  like control clicking and autocomplete

Tips in the editors:

******************Tip #1************************************************
ctrl-spacebar to autocomplete stuff
************************************************************************

for example if you had "Assert." and after the period you press ctrl-
spacebar, it'll popup the autocomplete.  if you do the same for
"Assert.assertEq", you would have the autocomplete make the educated
guess of assertEquals() methods to select from.

This autocomplete works great for certain keyword coding templates.
Here a few... try them out yourself.

type "sysout", then press control-space.  see what you get do the same
for syserr

Also if you want to traverse a collection or enumeration: type "while"
and then press control-space, then it'll give you options about what
you to loop over like: iterate with iterator, iterate with
enumeration, iterate with condition.

it'll automatically create the template of:

while(condition)
{
}

or

while (it.hasNext())
{
       type elem = (type) it.next();
}

you can then press tab through each boxed in keyword to fill in the
details

in fact you can type any java keyword, classname method etc, and it
should auto complete it.

kinda neat that you don't have to deal with details of code,because
you let the engineering tools do the heavy lifting for you.

************Tip #2******************************************************
press ctrl-1 to autofix problems -  just try it, it gives good suggestions
************************************************************************

************Tip #3******************************************************
Jumping into methods, classes, variables etc - highlight a method,
classname, or variable and press F3  or hold down ctrl, mouse over a
method, classes, constants and click it
************************************************************************

This is great when tracing through code.  You can visually jump
through your code with your mouse.  Say goodbye to notepad, vi, emacs
for your java development.  If you do it that way, you're just being a
tough guy.  But, that's just my opinion because these advantages speed
things up.

************Tip #4******************************************************
Use the debugger - In menu bar: window - Open perspective - debug
It used to be terrible 5 years ago...but now it's good now
************************************************************************

It's nice to have a stack trace to see where things are getting called
and be able to trace through things.

************Tip #4******************************************************
Using the console to jump to code
************************************************************************

So if you have a piece of code blowing up to hell with the red
messages all over the place, you can click on those in the console to
jump right to the problems.  You can also jump to the lines with
problems from the junit tests in the console.  Usually they'll display
underlined with line number.


Hopefully these tricks will help speed up development and will have
you focus more on design and test cases.  These were picked up over
the years from short 15 second conversations with various developers.
Hopefully this will up productivity and will give you more time to
focus on hanging out at the beach, exercising, or getting coffee
without dragging along your laptop.

Anyways, have fun.
